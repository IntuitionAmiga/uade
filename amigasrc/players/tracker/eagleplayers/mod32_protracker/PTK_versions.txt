Differences/Compatibility issues between different Protracker replays.
######################################################################

PTK1.0c = Protracker replay 1.0c by Lars "Zap" Hamre/Amiga Freelancers
PTK1.1b = Protracker replay 1.1b by Lars "Zap" Hamre/Amiga Freelancers
PTK2.1a	= Protracker replay 2.1a by Peter "CRAYON" Hanning / Mushrooms Studios
PTK2.3a = Protracker replay 2.3a
PTK3.0b = Protracker 3.00b Tom "Outland" Bech and Ivar "Heatseeker" J. Olsen



mt_* and pt_* are ususally the labels of the functions in the replays.



Effect EFx:
-----------
PTK1.0c:
    mt_UpdateFunk: -> Funk repeat effect 

PTK1.1b and above
    mt_UpdateFunk: -> invert loop effect


Info: Protracker 1.0c and below had a completely different effect, when
effect 0xef was used. According to the replay it was called funk_repeat.
I miss a song, that really uses this feature.
Later Protrackers use invert loop for the 0xef effect. So songs
using the effect will most likely sound screwed up, when played with the
wrong replay.


Vibrato
-------
PTK1.0C:
    mt_vib_set:	-> lsr.w #6,d0

PTK1.1b and above:
    mt_vib_set:	-> lsr.w #7,d0


Info: Vibrato depth was changed for ptk1.1b and above.


PerNop:
-------
PTK1.0C:
    period is set in ->	mt_playvoice
			mt_CheckEfx after "and" via "beq.s"
			
PTK1.1b:
    period is set in ->	mt_playvoice
			mt_CheckEfx after "and" via "beq.s"
			mt_CheckMoreEfx

PTK2.1a:
    period is set in ->	mt_playvoice
			mt_CheckEfx after "and" via "beq.s"
			mt_CheckMoreEfx

PTK2.3a:
    period is set in ->	mt_playvoice
			mt_CheckEfx after "and" via "beq.s"
			mt_CheckMoreEfx

PK3.0B:
    period is set in -> pt_playvoice
			pt_CheckMoreEffects
    

Info: while protracker 1.1b-2.3a update the periods when playing the voices,
and while processing the effects/extended effects, ptk1.0c and ptk3.0b
only update it twice.
Th effect is recognizable with emax_enjoythesilence.mod. E.g. using
the way PTK1.0c sets the periods results in a rather flat sounding output
loosing some of its effects.


mt_UpdateFunk in mt_CheckMoreEfx:
----------------------------
PTK1.0c-2.3a:
    mt_UpdateFunk is called in the beginning of mt_CheckMoreEfx

PTK3.0b:
    mt_UpdateFunk is missing altogether in mt_CheckMoreEfx


Info: While Funkrepeat (0xef) is updated with the old values before the new
extended 0xe# effects are parsed, PTK3.0b doesn't. I yet have to find a mod
that "breaks", tho.



Portamento:
-----------
All PTK:
    first portamento up/down effect call is ignored due to unintialised
    value

Info: Noise/Soundtracker/Startrekker will sound broken when played as
Protracker and using Portamento.
