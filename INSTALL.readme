General Instructions for Installing UADE
========================================

* Dependencies

Compiling and running UADE requires some libraries depending on which
frontends you want to use:

 Frontend name  | Type           	| Dependencies
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 uade123        | Command line   	| libao: http://www.xiph.org/ao/
 xmms		| XMMS plugin	 	| XMMS
 audacious	| Audacious plugin	| Audacious:
					  http:/audacious-media-player.org


* Compiling and installation

The installation process has 3 or 4 steps.

(1) ./configure
(2) make
(3) make soundcheck (optional phase)
(4) make install (possibly run as root user)

Longer explanations of these steps follow:

(1) ./configure

  Look at which frontends will be compiled in. In the good case you will see:

  uade123                                 : yes
  XMMS plugin                             : yes
  .. other frontends


  You have the possibility of using many options, such as disabling possible
  frontends (methods for using uadecore through various systems such as the
  command line and XMMS). See ./configure --help for options. Some of the
  more important options are:

	--prefix
	--user

  --user makes uade to be installed into users ~/.uade2/ directory, but of
  course you may issue --prefix=$HOME/something to achieve the same effect.

  It is possible to leavy any uade frontend or even uadecore compiled so that
  packing for distributions is faster and easier. Important options for
  distribution packagers are:

	--package-prefix
	--without-uadecore
	--without-uade123
	--without-xmms

(2) make

  This will build all the components that were configured.

(3) make soundcheck

  You should hear sound if uade123 was compiled in and it works. If uade123
  was not compiled, you may still have success with other frontends such as
  the XMMS plugin. uade123 is only the command line player tool.

(4) make install

  This will install the software. If --user was used the uadecore and frontends
  are installed into ~/.uade2/.


Hints for various GNU/Linux distributions
=========================================

To install necessary dependencies for Gentoo, execute:

	emerge -u libao		(the dependency for uade123)
	emerge -u xmms

In Debian/Ubuntu, the required libraries can be downloaded by:

    for uade123:
	apt-get install libao-dev
    for xmms:
        apt-get install xmms-dev
    for audacious:
	apt-get install audacious-dev (get a mirror from
	                               audacious-mediaplayer.org)
