Ideas of things to do for UADE 2:

2006-01-04: Write a tool to truncate overly long modules.
2005-12-23: Add subsong text "[x/x]" into XMMS plugin scroller / playlist text
	    (ave)
2005-12-23: Add 16x16 hexdump for XMMS file info (ave)
2005-12-14: Generate a content db of uade rsync collection. (shd)
2005-12-07: Add dangerous malloc to test amifilemagic. (shd)
2005-12-07: Remove postprocessing.[ch]. Use only effects.[ch]. (shd)
2005-12-05: Interesting error message: Can not open module:
	    /svu/chip/./ahx/Opaque 1/AHX.Happy Vibes... It seems it can not
	    open files whose name end in whitespace.. (shd)
2005-11-06: System call book keeping for sound core (shd)
2005-10-10: Volume level normalization based on the database (grue)
2005-07-31: Song length database format. Contains following information:
		* Subsong lengths and volume levels
		* MD5 content checksum
		* File length
		* Mark information as static
		* Maybe: advisory file name, comment
	    (shd)
2005-07-22: command line interaction for seeking and skipping songs (shd)
2005-07-20: force timeout even if playtime is known (ave)
2005-07-20: fast forward seeking + GUI support (ave)
2005-07-12: convert asmone source code in sound core to gnu assembler format
	    (shd)
2005-07-12: rewrite parts of the sound core in C, and cross-compile with a
	    68k gcc. (shd)
2005-07-12: rewrite src/amifilemagic.c. It should be much cleaner. (shd)
2005-07-11: sync tool to update song length database (grue)


DONE:
2005-12-06: Support all variables of uade.conf in XMMS plugin. (shd)
2005-12-06: Write amiga decruncher tool, and make filemagic notify about using
	    that tool. Relevant formats are SQSH, power packer, and lha. (shd)
2005-11-28: XMMS plugin must not end prematurely. Wait for data to have been
	    actually played (rather than written) before stopping.
2005-07-17: start audio output from simulator to the client after sound core
	    has initialized the player plugin. currently the simulator
	    writes zero audio samples during the initialization in sound core.
	    (shd)
