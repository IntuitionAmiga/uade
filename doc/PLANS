Ideas of things to do for UADE 2:

2005-07-17: start audio output from simulator to the client after sound core
	    has initialized the player plugin. currently the simulator
	    writes zero audio samples during the initialization in sound core.
	    (shd)
2005-07-12: convert asmone source code in sound core to gnu assembler format
	    (shd)
2005-07-12: rewrite parts of the sound core in C, and cross-compile with a
	    68k gcc. (shd)
2005-07-12: rewrite src/amifilemagic.c. It should be much cleaner. (shd)
2005-07-11: good song length database format (supports subsong lengths) (shd)
2005-07-11: sync tool to update song length database (grue)
