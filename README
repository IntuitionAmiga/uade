Very short instructions for UADE 2:

1. Read INSTALL.readme
2. Install the program globally or directly to your home directory. Do either
	./configure
   or
	./configure --user  (makes uade to be installed under ~/.uade2)
3. make
4. make install (as root if installed globally, but as the user if configure
   was given --user)

The program is ready now.

Now you can edit uade.conf, if you want. uade.conf is located at
$PREFIX/share/uade2/uade.conf or ~/.uade2/uade.conf. If you installed
globally, you can make a copy of uade.conf to ~/.uade2/.

Fire up xmms, audacious or use the command line tool.

$ uade123 -zr /my/chips
