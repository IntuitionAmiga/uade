Ideas of things to do for UADE 2:

2005-07-31: Song length database format. Contains following information:
		* subsong lengths and volume levels
		* md5 content checksum
		* file length
		* mark information as static
		* maybe: advisory file name, comment
	    (shd)
2005-07-22: command line interaction for seeking and skipping songs (shd)
2005-07-20: force timeout even if playtime is known (ave)
2005-07-20: fast forward seeking + GUI support (ave)
2005-07-12: convert asmone source code in sound core to gnu assembler format
	    (shd)
2005-07-12: rewrite parts of the sound core in C, and cross-compile with a
	    68k gcc. (shd)
2005-07-12: rewrite src/amifilemagic.c. It should be much cleaner. (shd)
2005-07-11: sync tool to update song length database (grue)


DONE:

2005-07-17: start audio output from simulator to the client after sound core
	    has initialized the player plugin. currently the simulator
	    writes zero audio samples during the initialization in sound core.
	    (shd)
