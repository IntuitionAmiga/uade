Ideas of things to do for UADE 2:

2005-07-12: convert asmone source code in sound core to gnu assembler format
	    (shd)
2005-07-12: rewrite parts of the sound core in C, and cross-compile with a
	    68k gcc. (shd)
2005-07-12: rewrite src/amifilemagic.c. It should be much cleaner. (shd)
2005-07-11: good song length database format (supports subsong lengths) (shd)
2005-07-11: sync tool to update song length database (grue)
