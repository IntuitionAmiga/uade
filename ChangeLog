        * UADE 1.50-pre1 (developer release)
	- Lots of changes into uade123
	- This is just a preview of the new system. There are no interesting
	  features over uade 1.0x versions. This release doesn't even have
	  xmms / beepmp plugins.
	- Short instructions for testing:
	   $ ./configure && make
	   $ make test
	   $ make install
	  Will install everything to $(HOME)/.uade2/. Then
	  $(HOME)/.uade2/uade123 is the player you can use. This version
	  uses libao for audio output.

	- Code in src/amifilemagic.c does amiga fileformats detection. If it's
	  useful for any other project out there, it is now dual licensed
	  under the GNU GPL _and_ Public Domain. By public domain we mean
	  that you can do anything you like with the code, including
	  relicensing arbitrarily for your projects.

	- Improved the command line frontend in src/frontends/trivial/,
	  and now it is called uade123. It can now do fileformat detection by
	  content, and load proper players from their installation place.
	  Also, it can play multiple songs in a sequence if one switches to
	  next song with ctrl-c before the song actually ends. If the song
	  ends by itself, the system will crash ;) 
	- Found a bug in amifilemagic by accident. chk_id_offset() function
	  tested patterns of length sizeof(patterns[i]) which is totally
	  wrong. It was corrected to strlen(patterns[i]).

	- started hacking uade. the goal is to release uade 2.00 someday
	  http://board.kohina.com/viewtopic.php?p=3499#3499
	- these changes start a series. version 1.50 will be the first public
	  release in this series.
	- src/frontends/trivial/ can now play single file songs
	- debugging is broken because libao can't handle signals well
	- tons of things missing from the system
