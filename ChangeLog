	- Added shell interaction keys into UADE123. The keys can be enabled
	  with -k switch, or adding line "action_keys" into uade.conf.
	  The keys are (mimiking XMMS):
	    z     - Previous subsong
	    c     - Pause
	    b     - Next subsong
	    n     - Next song
	    .     - Skip 10 seconds forward
	    ENTER - Next song
	    SPACE - Next subsong
	  Does someone want these configurable into uade.conf? Please email
	  me.

	* UADE 1.50-pre3 (developer release)
	- Added a -j to skip x seconds of audio from the beginning. Note that
	  this does not affect timeout parameters in any way. If timeout is
	  1 minute and skip is 2 minutes, the song will just end before
	  anything is played.

	- Added silence timeout
	- Wrote a config file parser for uade123. Look at uade.conf file
	  for instructions. uade123 tries to load following files in order on
	  startup: BASEDIR/uade.conf and $(HOME)/.uade2/uade.conf. Command
	  line options can override config file parameters. Users of uade123
	  might want to configure timeout, panning and such values as
	  personal defaults. This is a very important feature important over
	  uade 1.0x command line tool.
	- Restructured uade123 code into different code modules to make
	  maintaining and code reuse easier.

	- Fixed a bug in uade123 that prevented it from playing the last
	  subsong of a song.

	* UADE 1.50-pre2 (developer release)
	- uade123 now has eagleplayer fileformat check ignoring feature (-i),
	  panning (-p), song timeout (-t), and subsong timeouts (-w)

2005-07-17  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- uade123 now uses GNU getopt
	- uade123 can now output both raw and wav formats by using libao
	  file output mechanism. Wav format is the default. Example:
	  uade123 -e wav -f foo.wav songfile
	- The sound core now reports to the simulator when audio output should
	  start. Traditionally the simulator has produced audio output from
	  the reboot of the amiga even if it is only useful to output audio
	  after all the lengthy player initializations have been made in
	  the sound core. For example, AHX.Cruisin now has 0.96 seconds less
	  zero samples in the beginning.
	- Cleaned up sound core a bit. Removed some unused definitions
	  of messages between sound core and the simulator. Removed unused
	  code that was designed to be used when running sound core under a
	  _real_ AmigaOS.
	- Made uade123 less verbose. Use -v option to get more details.
	- Renamed uade-trivial.c to 'uade123.c' in src/frontends/uade123
	- Renamed directory 'trivial' to 'uade123' in src/frontends/

        * UADE 1.50-pre1 (developer release)
	- Lots of changes into uade123
	- This is just a preview of the new system. There are no interesting
	  features over uade 1.0x versions. This release doesn't even have
	  xmms / beepmp plugins.
	- Short instructions for testing:
	   $ ./configure && make
	   $ make test
	   $ make install
	  Will install everything to $(HOME)/.uade2/. Then
	  $(HOME)/.uade2/uade123 is the player you can use. This version
	  uses libao for audio output.

	- Code in src/amifilemagic.c does amiga fileformats detection. If it's
	  useful for any other project out there, it is now dual licensed
	  under the GNU GPL _and_ Public Domain. By public domain we mean
	  that you can do anything you like with the code, including
	  relicensing arbitrarily for your projects.

2005-07-11  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- Improved the command line frontend in src/frontends/trivial/,
	  and now it is called uade123. It can now do fileformat detection by
	  content, and load proper players from their installation place.
	  Also, it can play multiple songs in a sequence if one switches to
	  next song with ctrl-c before the song actually ends. If the song
	  ends by itself, the system will crash ;) 
	- Found a bug in amifilemagic by accident. chk_id_offset() function
	  tested patterns of length sizeof(patterns[i]) which is totally
	  wrong. It was corrected to strlen(patterns[i]).

2005-07-09  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>
	- started hacking uade. the goal is to release uade 2.00 someday
	  http://board.kohina.com/viewtopic.php?p=3499#3499
	- these changes start a series. version 1.50 will be the first public
	  release in this series.
	- src/frontends/trivial/ can now play single file songs
	- debugging is broken because libao can't handle signals well
	- tons of things missing from the system
