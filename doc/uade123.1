.SH "NAME"
UADE \- Unix Amiga Delitracker Emulator
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B uade123
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIfiles\fR ...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.BR uade123
plays old amiga music formats by emulating Amiga hardware. It
re-uses Amiga Eagleplayer plugins to play different formats. Eagleplayer
plugins require an implementation of the Eagleplayer API and AmigaOS APIs
to run on. Therefore Eagleplayer API and parts of AmigaOS have been
implemented in uade.

uade123 is a command line player that can be used to play Amiga songs. It's
options and behavior are documented here. There is also a plugin for the
.BR xmms
(1).

Section
.BR FILE\ FORMAT\ DETECTION
explains hardships of recognizing amiga formats and consequently problems it
may cause for the user (and authors).

Section
.BR COMMAND\ LINE\ OPTIONS
documents command line options for uade123.

Section
.BR ACTION\ KEYS
documents action keys which are used to issue run-time commands to control
playback. These commands include switching subsong, skipping to next song,
skipping fast forward, pausing and altering post-processing effects.

Section
.BR CONFIGURATION\ FILES
documents variables which can be changed in
.BR eagleplayer.conf ,
.BR song.conf
and
.BR uade.conf
to alter default behavior of uade123 and other frontends.
.BR eagleplayer.conf
is used for eagleplayer plugin specific configurations.
.BR song.conf
is used for song specific configurations which can be used to change
sound effects or avoid problems.
.BR uade.conf
is the main configuration file that can be used to set defaults for
variables. Command line options will always override uade.conf options.

.SH "FILE FORMAT DETECTION"
Creating file detection heuristics for 200 formats is difficult and most of
those formats are undocumented or otherwise not easily recognizable. Therefore
we have to detect some formats by file name prefixes and postfixes which
can easily cause problems. For example, many different protracker variants
are named with 'mod' prefix and the format lacks version number inside
the data file making it rather hard to recognize proper mod variant. 
Sound output can be buggy with some unrecognizable mod variants. When file
format can not be deduced based on file contents, a heuristics based on the
file name must be used. This may sound strange, but many of the
m68k machine language player plugins are black boxes which have no reliable
mechanism to validate whether a given file belongs to them or not.
In uade123 the filename based heuristics may cause
unrecognized songs and in XMMS it can cause conflicts with other plugins.
.BR contrib/uadexmmsadd
script can be used to add uade:// prefixed playlist entries into XMMS to
avoid conflicts with some of the existing mod plugins for XMMS. However,
we recommend disabling conflicting XMMS plugins if convenient.

.SH "COMMAND LINE OPTIONS"

\fB\-1, \-\-one\fR
Play at most one subsong per file.
.TP
\fB\-@\fR filename\fB, \-\-list=\fRfilename
Play song files listed in the file.
.TP
\fB\-\-buffer\-time\fR=x
Set audio buffer length to x milliseconds. It can be used to avoid audio
underruns on some systems. The default value of this setting is provided
by the libao. Notice that libao support for ALSA has a bug
in versions 0.8.6 and earlier that buffer_time must actually be given in
microseconds rather than milliseconds.
.TP
\fB\-d, \-\-debug\fR
Turn debug mode on. Experts only.
.TP
\fB\-\-detect\-format\-by\-content\fR
Set file magic mode. The songs are only detected by file contents.
File name based heuristics (prefixes and postfixes) are not used.
.TP
\fB\-\-disable\-timeouts\fR
Disable timeouts. The frontend will never timeout a song.
.TP
\fB\-\-enable\-timeouts\fR
Enable timeouts. The frontend will normally timeout a song.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR format
Set output file format. Use with
.BR -f .
.TP
\fB\-f\fR filename
Output sound data to filename.
.TP
\fB\-\-filter\fR
Enable filter emulation. It is enabled by default but could be disabled from
uade.conf.
.TP
\fB\-\-filter=\fRx
Set filter emulation mode to
.BR x .
x is a500, a1200 or none. A500 is
the default. 'none' means disabling the filter. Please note that A500 and A1200
are audibly different on every
song even if a song doesn't use filtering.
Surprisingly, the biggest
difference between A500 and A1200 is filter behavior when LED is off (i.e.
song doesn't use filtering). When LED is off, A1200 does very little filtering
but A500 does some filtering that can be easily heard. Please try switching
between A500 and A1200 modes. You should get same results with real
Amigas too :-)
.TP
\fB\-\-force\-led=\fRx
Force Amiga filter on or off. 0 means "OFF" and 1 means "ON".
.TP
\fB\-\-frequency=\fRx
Set output frequency to x Hz. The default is 44,1 kHz. Note that this option
applies to all frontends (including Audacious and XMMS plugins).
.TP
\fB\-G, \-\-gain=\fRx
Set volume gain to
.BR x .
x must be a non-negative value. The default value is 1,0.
.TP
\fB\-g, \-\-get\-info\fR
Print playername and subsong information to stdout and then exit. This is
useful for recording script.
.TP
\fB\-\-headphones\fR
Enable headphones postprocessing effect.
.TP
\fB\-\-headphones2\fR
Enable headphones 2 postprocessing effect.
.TP
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
Print command line help.
.TP 
\fB\-i,	\-\-ignore\fR
Force eagleplayer to play the song.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR x\fB, \-\-jump=\fRx
Jump to song position of x seconds.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR x\fB, \-\-keys=\fRx
Turn action keys on (x = 1) or off (x = 0).
.TP
\fB\-m\fR filename
Set module filename.
.TP
\fB\-n, \-\-no\-ep\-end-detect\fR
Play music ad infinitum by ignoring song end reported by the eagleplayer.
Note that this does not affect timeouts.
.TP
\fB\-\-ntsc\fR
Set NTSC mode. This can be buggy.
.TP
\fB\-\-pal\fR
Set PAL mode. This is the default.
.TP 
\fB\-p\fR x, \-\-panning=\fRx
Set panning effect to x. This means mixing left and right channel affinely
together. n is a value between 0 and 2. 0 is full stereo, 1 is mono and
2 is inverse stereo.
.TP 
\fB\-P\fR playerfile
Set filename of the eagleplayer.
.TP 
\fB\-r, \-\-recursive\fR
Play directories recursively.
.TP
\fB\-\-repeat\fR
Play playlist over and over again.
.TP
\fB\-\-resampler=\fRs
Set resampling method to
.BR s .
It can be
.BR default ,
.BR sinc
or
.BR none .
See RESAMPLERS section for more information.
.TP 
\fB\-s\fR n\fB, \-\-subsong=\fRn
Choose subsong n.
.TP 
\fB\-S\fR scorefile
Set filename of sound core. Experts only. Useful for debugging sound core
related problems. Picking score file from earlier releases may help revealing
the problem source.
.TP
\fB\-\-set=\fR"options"
Set song.conf options for given songs. Songs are not played in this mode,
only song.conf is updated. Example: uade123 --set="gain=2" foo.
.TP 
\fB\-\-speed\-hack\fR
Enable speedhack. Emulate all instructions to be executed
in one m68k cycle. Some players, such as EMS v6, take too
many m68k cycles to be real\-time. This option gives them
enough m68k cycles. Notice that you do _not_ need to use this
switch with EMS v6 or Octamed, because it is automatically enabled for
those formats. A replayer usually knows to ask for speedhack.
.TP
\fB\-\-stderr\fR
Print all messages on stderr. This is useful if one uses -f /dev/stdout as
a trick to pipe sample data on the command line.
.TP 
\fB\-t\fR x\fB, \-\-timeout=\fRx
Set song time out to x seconds. Default is infinite (-1).
.TP 
\fB\-w\fR x\fB, \-\-subsong\-timeout=\fRx
Set subsong timeout to x seconds. -1 means infinite. Default is 512 seconds.
.TP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR
Turn verbose mode on. This is useful for debugging strange situations.
.TP
\fB\-x, \-\-ep-option=\fRy
Use eagleplayer option y. For example, to force a module to be played as a
Protracker 1.1b module, execute: uade123 -x type:pt11b mod.foobar
.TP 
\fB\-y\fR x\fB, \-\-silence\-timeout=\fRx.
Set silence timeout to x seconds. If x seconds of silence is detected the
(sub)song ends.
.TP 
\fB\-z, \-\-shuffle\fR
Randomize playlist order before playing.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
All configuration files are in a line based format. This means that line breaks
(\\n) must be used properly. Lines beginning with # are comment lines. Empty
lines are ignored.
.SH eagleplayer.conf
Each line in
.BR eagleplayer.conf
sets eagleplayer specific options. It is used, among other things,
to specify file name extensions to different formats. It has the format:
.sp 1
playername prefixes=prefix1,prefix2,... [opt1 opt2 ...] [comment]
.sp 1
.BR playername
refers to an existing eagleplayer in players/ directory.
.BR prefixes
is a list of file prefixes and postfixes that are associated with
this eagleplayer.
.BR opt1 ,
.BR opt2
and so forth are options that can be given to the player.

Valid options for eagleplayer.conf are listed in the
.BR song.conf
section.
.sp 1
Some example lines for eagleplayer.conf:
.sp 1
custom          prefixes=cust
.br
fred            prefixes=fred           broken_song_end
.br
PTK-Prowiz      prefixes=mod,pha,pp10   always_ends
.br
EMSv6           prefixes=emsv6          speed_hack
.br
foobar          comment: this format is not detected by a filename
                prefix but file content as it should be
.SH song.conf
.BR song.conf
is a configuration file for applying work-arounds for songs that
have problems with eagleplayers. Protracker is especially notorious
for having many incompatible versions, and modules do not have version
information about the editor which was used to create them.

The file shall have lines of following format:
.sp 1
md5=XXX option1 [option2 ...] [comment: YYY]
.sp 1
Valid options for eagleplayer.conf and song.conf:
.sp 1
a500                 Use A500 filter emulation
.br
a1200                Use A1200 filter emulation
.br
always_ends          A song will always end. This means that song end
                     detection code is perfect so timeouts in uade.conf
                     can be ignored. However, timeouts given from
                     command line will override this setting.
.br
broken_song_end      Song end reported by the eagleplayer is ignored
.br
detect_format_by_content  A song can only be detected by contents,
                     never by filename prefix or postfix
.br
epopt=x              Append option x for eagleplayer. Valid options
                     are listed in section "EAGLEPLAYER OPTIONS".
.br
gain=x               Set gain value to x
.br
led_off              Force LED off
.br
led_on               Force LED on
.br
no_filter            No filtering (avoid this option, using a1200 is
                     better)
.br
no_headphones,       No headphone effect
.br
no_panning           No panning
.br
no_postprocessing    No postprocessing effects
.br
ntsc                 Uses NTSC timing (can be buggy)
.br
one_subsong          Play only one subsong per file
.br
pal                  Uses PAL timing
.br
panning=x            Set panning value to x
.br
player=name          Set eagleplayer, where name is the directory entry
                     in players/ dir. This option is not allowed in
                     eagleplayer.conf.
.br
reject               Reject a song (usable for blacklisting). This
                     option is not allowed in eagleplayer.conf.
.br

.sp 1
.BR comment
is a tag after which everything is considered just a comment
about the line.
.sp 1
Those options should be self-explanatory ;) A few example lines for song.conf:
.sp 1

.SH uade.conf
.BR uade.conf
sets default variables for configuration settings. Each line
may contain at most one command. The configuration file is read from
users home directory (
.BR $HOME/.uade2/uade.conf
) if it exists. If it does not
exist, it is tried from
.BR $PREFIX/share/uade2/uade.conf
 . Making a copy of the
uade.conf into $HOME/.uade2/ can be useful for users. The same uade.conf
controls settings for all frontends. Specifically, this includes the XMMS
plugin too.

.SH "SONG TITLE SPECIFICATION"
Song title for GUI frontends can be specified by using song_title option
in uade.conf. The default value for specification is %F %X [%P].
Following items are allowed in the specification:
.sp 1
    %F - filename                 %T - songtitle
.br
    %P - player or formatname 
.br
    %A - minimum subsong          %B - current subsong
.br
    %C - maximum subsong          %X - only display subsongs when more
                                  than one
.sp 1
An example of alternative specification that displays the song name
received from the eagleplayer (as opposed to file name):
.sp 1
    song_title %T %X [%P]

.SH "EAGLEPLAYER OPTIONS"
Eagleplayers can be given song specific or general options in song.conf
and eagleplayer.conf. Use epopt=x to set one option. It can be used many
times. You can also issue eagleplayer options from the command line
(so that they are not stored into song.conf) by using -x option:
"uade123 -x type:nt10 mod.foobar" will play mod.foobar as a Noisetracker
1.0 module. With -x option "epopt=" prefix must be dropped.
.sp 1
Valid options for eagleplayers:
.sp 1
PTK-Prowiz          epopt=vblank
                    epopt=type:<tracker>
                               <tracker> can be one of the following:

.SH "SUPPORTED FORMATS"
Quite a few. See documentation, eagleplayer.conf and players/ directory.
.SH "RESAMPLERS"
Internally Amigas Paula chip operates at 3,5 MHz, and in theory, it is
possible to generate a 1,75 MHz output signal. However, maximum DMA based
sample rate, which is approximately 28876 Hz, is limited by chip memory
access slots. These frequencies are not well supported with current
computer equipment, and synthesizing samples at 3,5 MHz would be very slow.
Therefore UADE resamples Paulas 3,5 MHz output to a typical computers
sampling rate; 44,1 kHz or 1/80th sample rate of Paula. This output
frequency is configurable, see
.BR uade.conf
section.
.sp 1
UADE currently supports three resampling methods:
.BR none
that does not do any filtering;
.BR default
that filters the output by averaging the last 80 samples together (also known
as boxcar filter). This is the recommended resampler; and
.BR sinc
that produces flat frequency response to about 19.5 kHz and attenuates
completely soon thereafter.
.sp 1
The default resampler is a very good choice because it is pretty accurate
and very fast, but loses some treble and causes some aliasing distortion.
For high frequencies (above 44,1 kHz), sinc might give the best sound quality.
.SH "FILTERS"
The Amiga output circuitry contained a low-pass filter on most models, and the
lowpass filter connected to the power LED, known as "LED filter". On the
Amiga 1000
which was the first Amiga computer, the LED filter was permanently enabled. For
the Amiga 500, the LED filter was made optional, but an additional RC filter
circuit
was connected that applied some lowpass filtering on the audio output. Finally,
for Amiga 1200, the audio output path was unfiltered when the LED filter
was disabled.
.sp 1
These low-pass filters were likely added in order to control the effects that
Amiga's
pulse waveforms had. In AGA graphics modes, Amiga 1200 can exceed the
28867 Hz sampling
frequency, and it is likely that the lowpass filter was removed to improve
the audio
playback for the new graphics modes.
.sp 1
The filter emulation is based on hi-fi measurements made on two particular
Amiga computers, Amiga 500 and Amiga 1200. The Amiga 500 output path
contains a fixed 6 dB/oct lowpass RC filter circuit with cutoff at 5000 Hz.
(Some early Amiga 500 revisions may have had 4500 Hz tuning for this filter.)
The LED filter is known to be a 12 dB/oct Butterworth lowpass filter with
cutoff
value at approximately 1650 Hz. The details of the Amiga 1000 filter
arrangements are not known.
.sp 1
Straightforward emulation of analog filters is usually not possible without
some upsampling. Therefore the filters are currently realised with several
hand-fitted first order IIR filters that approximate the correct frequency
response with likely synthesis frequencies such as 44,1 kHz and 48 kHz.
.sp 1
However, by using an upsampled design it is possible to exactly duplicate
the analog
filters across the audible frequency band. UADE may, in the future, opt to
use an upsampled filter design when high-quality output is requested
by the user.

.B INCREASING AMIGA MEMORY FOR LARGE MODULE FILES
.sp 1
uaerc can be edited to increase Amiga memory. The
variable named chipmem_size (4 by default) controls the memory
allocation. The allocated memory size is determined by formula
chipmem_size * 512 KiB, and thus, there is 2 MiB of memory available
for modules by default. This variable can be set up to 16, which would
mean 8 MiB of memory for modules.
