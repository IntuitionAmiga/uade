	- improved src/frontends/trivial/, and now it is called uade123
	- found a bug in amifilemagic by accident. chk_id_offset() function
	  tested patterns of length sizeof(patterns[i]) which is totally
	  wrong. it was corrected to strlen(patterns[i])

	- started hacking uade. the goal is to release uade 2.00 someday
	  http://board.kohina.com/viewtopic.php?p=3499#3499
	- these changes start a series. version 1.50 will be the first public
	  release in this series.
	- src/frontends/trivial/ can now play single file songs
	- debugging is broken because libao can't handle signals well
	- tons of things missing from the system
